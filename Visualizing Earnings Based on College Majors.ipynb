    "# Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors\n",
    "\n",
    "American Community Survey ACS https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ is a demographic survey organization run by the U.S. Census Bureau to better understand communities. Information from their surveys generate data that help determine how money is spent by federal and state governments. Their surveys are excellent sources for local business, hospitals, schools, and community leaders planning and making decisions.  Examples of some of their survey topics include jobs, occupations, educational attainment, veterans, and housing, just to name a few. The survey for this project; 'Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors,'comes from a survey ACS conducted and aggregated on job outcomes of college students between 2010 and 2012. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Majors, Income, Employment and Gender Correlations \n",
    "This project is for the completion of the DataQuest.io https://www.dataquest.io/ \"Exploratory Data Visualization\" module; the fourth in a series for the completing Data Science course path. For this assignment, questions will be answered using the material focused on up to this point in the course, with particular consideration for the new material introduced in this module. This material includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the Pandas library to quickly generate common plots from data.\n",
    "- Understanding the underlying functionality of the Matplotlib library.\n",
    "- Plot customization using Figure, Axes, and other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Majors as a Whole\n",
    "The analysis was broken into two parts. The first part focused on salary and unemployment rate of the most popular majors. (The sample size is related to the total size, which defines the 'popularity' of a college major in the context of this learning project). The following questions were addressed: \n",
    "- What are the most popular majors?\n",
    "- Do students graduating with these degrees make more money? \n",
    "- What is the unemployment rate for these majors? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Majors with Men and Women\n",
    "The second part focused on female dominated majors vs. male dominated majors and the following questions were addressed? \n",
    "- What majors have the largest share of women? What majors have the largest share of men? \n",
    "- What is the median salary for these majors? \n",
    "- What is the unemployment rate for these majors? \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Results\n",
    "Nursing is a very popular and a good choice for all students to consider. The salary is well above average and the unemployment rate is well below average. Psychology is not a good choice for either men or women. Although it's one of the most popular, it has a lower than average salary and a higher than average unemployment rate. \n",
    "Both male and female students would do well pursuing certain degrees that are dominated by the opposite sex. Medical assisting services, which consisted of 92% women, pays above average and has a lower than average unemployment rate. Mechanical engineering, which is 92% men has a higher than average salary and a lower than average unemployment rate as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "See the analysis for further details. "

    "The average median salary for students graduating from female majority disciplines was \\\\$33,961.The top five majors with the highest percentage of women were Early Childhood Education, Communication Disorders Sciences and Services, Medical Assisting Services, Elementary Education, and Family and Consumer Science. Even though four of five of these degrees had a lower salaries, the unemployment rate for all five was lower than the population. Medical Assisting Services, which consisted of 92% women, stood out with the highest salary of \\\\$42,000, and the second lowest unemployment rate of 4.24% Only Early Childhood Education had a lower unemployment rate of 4.01%; however, with a salary of only \\\\$28,000 it was the lowest paying.\n",

    "The average median salary for students graduating from male majority disciplines was \\\\$34,272. The top five majors with the highest percentage of men were Military Technologies, Mechanical Engineering and Related Technologies, Construction Services, Mining and Mineral Engineering, and Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering. Although Military Technologies was 100% men and an unemployment rate of 0%, the sample size was only 4. As a matter-of-fact, the sample sizes for the three of the five, primarily male dominated degrees were too small to draw any conclusion. Only Mechanical Engineering and Construction Services had high enough sample sizes to draw any reasonable conclusions. Both had over 90% men, and both paid at least 10% more than the median. They both had unemployment rates exceeding 5.6%, which was better than the median, but not as good as the female dominated majors.   "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The data set contained 173 rows and 21 columns. Only one row was removed for having null values. Each row contained a number of samples per major totaling \n",
    "61,566.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Majors as a Whole\n",
    "Business Management and Administration, Marketing and Marketing Research, Psychology, Nursing, and Communications were the top 5 most popular majors. Of those, Nursing, paid the best at \\\\$48,000, well above the \\\\$36,000 median salary for the entire population. By contrast, Psychology, the 3rd most popular, paid the worst at \\\\$31,000. Regarding unemployment, Nursing students fared the best with an unemployment rate of only 4.5\\%, which was below the median of 6.75%. By contrast, the unemployment rate for Psychology majors was 8.38\\%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nursing is a very good choice for all students to consider. The salary is well above average and the unemployment rate is well below average. Psychology is not a good choice. Although it's one of the most popular, it has a lower than average salary and a higher than average unemployment rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular Majors with Men and Women\n",
    "The average median salary for students graduating from female majority disciplines was \\\\$33,961. Medical Assisting Services, which consisted of 92% women, stood out with the highest salary of \\\\$42,000, and the second lowest unemployment rate of 4.24%. Early Childhood Education paid the lowest at $28,000, but only had a 4.01% unemployment rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average median salary for students graduating from male majority disciplines was \\\\$34,272. Only Mechanical Engineering and Construction Services had high enough sample sizes to draw any reasonable conclusions from. Both had over 90% men, and both paid at least 10% more than the median. However; they both had unemployment rates exceeding 5.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Male and female students would do well pursuing certain degrees that are dominated by the opposite gender. Medical Assisting Services, which consisted of 92% women, pays above average and has a lower than average unemployment rate. Mechanical Engineering, which is 92% men has a higher than average salary and a lower than average unemployment rate as well."
