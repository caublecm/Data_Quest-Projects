    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts \n",

    "\n",
    "## What Hacker News is and How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker News https://news.ycombinator.com/ is a social news website focused on computer science and investment. It was started by an American seed money startup accelerator Y Combinator https://www.ycombinator.com/, where user-submitted stories (referred to as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon. The concept is similar to the broader and highly popular platform, Reddit https://www.reddit.com/, where posts move to the top of the listings by users upvoting the content. This can result in hundreds of thousands of views. But, unlike Reddit, users cannot downvote content until they have accumulated enough \"karma\" points. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining Ask Posts and Show Posts\n",
    "This project will focus primarily on posts whose titles begin with \"Ask HN\" and \"Show HN\" Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are some examples of Ask HN posts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\n",
    "- Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "- Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. Below are some examples of Show HN posts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\n",
    "- Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "- Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantifying and Comparing Ask Posts and Show Posts\n",
    "This project is for the completion of the DataQuest.io https://www.dataquest.io/ \"Python for Data Science Intermediate\" module; the second in a series for the completing Data Science course path. For this assignment, the following questions will be answered using the material focused on up to this point in the course, with particular consideration for the new material introduced in this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Working with and cleaning data with strings.\n",
    "- Working with dates and times; particularly, the datetime module. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to explore the data, and use our new found knowledge to answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the number of Ask Post and Show Posts? \n",
    "- Which one receives more comments on average? \n",
    "- What is the average number of comments per post \n",
    "- At what hour of the day are the majority of comments posted?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of the Results\n",
    "There were 20,100 posts in our data set, with only about 14% of them being either Ask Posts or Show Posts. Of the ones that were, there were 50% more Ask Posts than Show Posts, and Ask Post received almost 3% more comments on average. It was determined that 3:00 pm EST was the most popular, time to post to an Ask Post comment. It was interesting to find that the second most popular time was 2:00 am in the morning. A good follow up would be to determine why so many Hacker users are up so early (or so late).\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "There were 20,100 posts in our Hacker News Posts data set; a sampling downloaded from Kaggle of the original scraped data containing over 300,000. Of the 20,100 posts, about 14% were either Ask Posts or Show Posts. There were 1742 Ask Post and 1161 Show Posts with Ask Posts exceeded the number of Show Posts by 50%. There were on average 14 comments associated with each Ask Post, in contrast to 10 per Show Posts. With 3% more comments per Ask Posts, the data was filtered further to determine the Top 5 hours in which comments were posted. At 3:00 pm EST, there were 38.59 average comments per post, followed by 2:00 am EST, with 23.81 average comments per hour. It was surprising to see so many users commenting at 2:00 am EST. "
