    "####  The goal of this project is to help our developers (at our imaginary company) understand what apps are likely to attract the most users. At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and that are directed toward an English-speaking audience. Our revenue is highly influenced by the number of people using our apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Strategy\n",
    "#### Our validation strategy is based on our overall business strategy: \n",
    "1. ##### Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.\n",
    "2. ##### If the app has a good response from users, we develop it further.\n",
    "3. ##### If the app is profitable after six months, we build an iOS version of the app and add it to the Apple App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology \n",
    "#### After we cleaned the data, we found the percentage of apps that existed within each genre for both the App Store and Google Play Store. Then we drilled down to the user ratings and reviews to determine customer preferences. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Results Summary\n",
    "#### We recommend that our developers prioritize general, practical, and/or educational applications for the Google Play Store Market. If these are successful after six months, launch them on the Apple App Store.  If management wants to grow the market, and if resources exist, they should consider re-evaluating the business strategy to launch entertainment and gaming apps directly to the Apple App Store.  \n",

We found their apps more evenly distributed with no particular category or genre standing out.  8.45% of the Google Play apps fall under the 'FAMILY' category. 'GAME' was half that at 9.00%. 8.36% fall under the 'Tools' genre. 'Entertainment' was 6.13%.    "

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "#### In this project, we analyzed samples of data from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to develop an apps profile that our developers could use to target certain markets and audiences. We focused on free, English language apps since that was our business criteria. The Apps Store was highly composed of 'fun' applications; particularly gaming, which was over 50% of their content. Their customers seemed to prefer the 'Social Networking', 'Photos & Videos' and 'Gaming' apps that they offered.   \n",
    "#### By contrast, the Google Play Store content was much broader and didn't have a dominating category or genre. Their apps were more focused on practical tools and applications, family, and education. Their customers seemed to prefer practical, and educational apps they offered.\n",
    "#### Based on our findings, we recommend that our developers prioritize general, practical, and/or educational applications for the Google Play Store Market. If these are successful after six months, launch them on the Apple App Store.  If management wants to expand the market, and if resources exist, they should consider re-evaluating the business strategy to launch entertainment and gaming apps directly to the Apple App Store.  "
